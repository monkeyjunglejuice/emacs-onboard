You are welcome! Here's the agenda what's currently important/worked on:

*** Catching up with Emacs 29 features
- Configuration based on Use-package in Emacs ONBOARD is postponed until Emacs 29 is in the Debian Stable repos; however ist will be [[https://github.com/monkeyjunglejuice/emacs.ontop][available in the Emacs ONTOP extension layer]].
- It's the same for Eglot. Common tasks are [[id:][preconfigured in Emacs ONTOP]].
*** Testing the config on various Emacsen and operating systems
- Flickering and delayed drawing happened under MacOS Sonoma 14.2.1, maybe due to tweaks for smooth scrolling, e.g. =(setq scroll-step 1=) or similar. Seems fixed.
*** Ensure portability between various host OS. All features should work in Linux, Windows and Mac equally well.
- Please report strange behaviors. I've switched to MacOS after 2+ decades pure Linux -- so I can do only some minor cross testing myself.
